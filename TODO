Add a larger inventory that stores all the spells you have gotten, and the hotbar is only the 4 spells that you have currently selected. press e to open inventory and swap out hotbar items for inventory items
===
BEFORE RELEASE: redo the mainScreen and make it look better, and be more responsive
===
add a wiki (at wiki.sorcer.io) that has all the spells, their stats, and what they do
===
BUG: if player's inventory.length is greater than 4 (or whatever the hotbar size is), new unlocked spells will still be pushed to the inventory, causing the inventory to be longer than 4 (or whatever the hotbar size is).
