BUG FIX BEFORE RELEASE: spells don't always get casted when player clicks, but the coolDownDisplay turns on, and the sound plays even if the spell wasn't successfully casted

BUG FIX BEFORE RELEASE: sometimes, when the client selects a spell from the unlockedSpells menu, the menu closes, the image click event is fired, callback function is fired, input gets pushed into local.quedInputs, but the server never receives the 'unlock' input

BEFORE RELEASE: redo the mainScreen and make it look better, and be more responsive

add a wiki (at wiki.sorcer.io) that has all the spells, their stats, and what they do
===
BUG: if player's inventory.length is greater than 4 (or whatever the hotbar size is), new unlocked spells will still be pushed to the inventory, causing the inventory to be longer than 4 (or whatever the hotbar size is).
